# Introduction to LangGraph

## Basic Cheat

Chat models in LangChain have a number of [default methods](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#runnable-interface). For the most part, we'll be using:

* `stream`: stream back chunks of the response
* `invoke`: call the chain on an input
in fact, it uses llm's as agents, and python codes/actions as tool, to delivery different structures to be used.
